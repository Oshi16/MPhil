Semantic Communication in UAV-Assisted Wireless Networks

Resaerch Objectives
1. Explore and implement Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) within semantic communication frameworks for UAV networks to enhance robustness and performance under varying interference conditions.

2. Investigate how Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) can enhance spectrum efficiency and support intelligent resource allocation strategies in UAV-assisted networks, optimizing energy usage, latency, and throughput.

3. Investigate semantic entropy and semantic mutual information as performance metrics to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, and applicability of semantic communication models in UAV networks.
